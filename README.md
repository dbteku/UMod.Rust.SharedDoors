2. If you are authorized and you are not in the clan. You cannot open the door/chest. (Prevents from base takeover via clan)

3. If you are not authorized and you are in the clan. You cannot open the door/chest.

4. If Clans is not installed the default behavior will be the same. If someone is authorized you can open the door/chest.
